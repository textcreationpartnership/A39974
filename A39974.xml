            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>¶ THe Patron, or the chief of the Pariſh where a new Church is erected, is to give timely notice to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, and humbly to deſire him to appoint a convenient time, ſome Lords day, or other great Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Church, for performance of the ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>At the day appointed, the Biſhop, with a convenient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Clergy (of which the Dean or Archdeacon to be one) and the Chancellor of the Dioceſs, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister ſhall come between the hours of eight and ten in the morning; and when they are neer, the bell is to ring till they be entred into the Church appointed to be conſecrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Firſt, the Biſhop and his Clergy, together with the Patron
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104442:3"/> or his Deputy, ſhall go round about the Coemitery, or Church-yard; which done, the Biſhop and his Clergy ſhall enter into the Church at the Weſt door, the Patron and people ſtanding without, while the Biſhop and Prieſts do vest themſelves in their reſpective Eccleſiaſtick habits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>When they are veſted, they ſhall kneel down in the body of the Church, with their faces to the Eaſt, and ſay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUr Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven: Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then the Biſhop ſhall pray,</hi>

            <p>PRevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy moſt gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help, that in all our works begun, continued and ended in thee, we may glorifie thy holy Name, and finally, by thy mercy obtain everlaſting life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then riſing up, they ſhall go together to the Weſt door, and the Dean or Archdeacon on one hand, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour on the other, ſhall bring the Patron to the threſhold of the Weſt door, and preſent him to the Biſhop; who ſhall thus ſay to him,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIr, I am come hither at your deſire; I ask therefore for what intent you have deſir'd my coming?</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104442:3"/>
            <p>¶ <hi>The Patron ſhall anſwer; or ſome of the Clergy at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and appointment, ſhall anſwer for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HE hath</hi>] or, <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> [I have cauſed a houſe to be built for the ſervice of God, and the publick Miniſteries of Religion, and ſeparated a burying place for my dead; and [his, or] my humble deſire is, that it may be ſet apart from all common and prophane uſes, and dedicated to the honour of God by your prayers, and holy Miniſteries, according to the Word of God, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Church.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Biſhop ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHiles it remained, was it not thine own? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is given to God, was it not in thine own power? but when once you give it to God, it can never be recalled, but is in his propriety for ever.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>The Patron or his Deputy ſhall anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly deſire he will be graciouſly pleaſed to accept it, and that it may remain his own for his ſervice, and his honour for ever.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Patron kneel down and receive the Biſhops bleſſing in the words following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>The Biſhop laying his hand upon, or lifting it over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons head, ſhall ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe Lord bleſs you, and proſper you; the Lord make his face to ſhine upon you, and be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. Remember thy ſervant, O God, concerning this

            </p>
            <p>And now in the Name of God, and to the honour of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let us perform this Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then the Patron ariſing, the Biſhop ſhall call for the inſtrument of Donation; which the Biſhop receiving from the hands of the Patron, ſhall deliver to the Regiſter to be read publikely in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Which being done, all may enter into the Church: Then ſhall the Biſhop, attended by his Clergy, kneel in the body of the Church; before the Chancel door, at a convenient diſtance, upon a footſtep raiſed higher than the floor, and ſhall ſay,</hi>

               <p>BLeſſed be thou, O Lord God, Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 10, &amp;c.</note> and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the Majeſtie: All that is in the heavens, and in the earth is thine.

But we know alſo, O God, that thou trieſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in uprightneſs. O Lord God of our Fathers, God of mercy, and Father of men and Angels, keep this, and all thankfulneſs, and piety, and devotion in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy ſervants for ever; and proſper thou the works of our hands unto us, O proſper thou our handy-work. Confirm this thing which thou haſt wrought in us, from thy holy Temple, which is in Jeruſalem, which is from above, and is the Mother of us all: And for ever be pleaſed to imploy us in thy ſervice, to ſtrengthen us in all obedience, to lead us in the way everlaſting, and to accept us in thoſe Religious duties which we ſhall perform by thy Commandment, and by the aſſiſtances of thy holy Spirit, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

               <p>O Almighty and Eternal God, who by thy Immenſity filleſt all places both in heaven and earth, and canſt not be limited or circumſcrib'd in any: Thou art the moſt High, and dwelleſt not, as we do, in houſes made with hands; for Heaven is thy Throne, and the earth is thy foot-ſtool; And what houſe can we build for thee? and what is the place of thy reſt, that we can furniſh out for thee? Surely every place is too little, and too low for thee, who dwelleſt on high, and thy glory is above the Heavens: And yet thou humbleſt thy ſelf to behold the things that are in heaven and earth, and thy delight is to be with the ſons of men. Thou ſpeakeſt our words, thou complieſt with our weakneſſes, thou accepteſt our ſervices, and wilt be worſhipped and ador'd according to what thou haſt put into our power. Thou therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104442:5"/> haſt been pleas'd in all ages to meet with thy ſervants in places ſeparate for thy worſhip, and for the invocation of thy holy Name. In Paradiſe there was a proper place which thy ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> called, <hi>The preſence of the Lord;</hi> and thy ſervant <hi>Abraham</hi> called on thy Name, in the <hi>place of the Altar:</hi> And thou didſt meet the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 4.</note> at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and he conſecrated a ſtone for thy memorial, and it became dreadful and venerable, the Houſe of God, and the Gate of Heaven; and <hi>Rebekah</hi> had a proper place <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note> whither ſhe went to inquire of the Lord. Thou alſo didſt fill the Tabernacle with thy preſence, and the Temple with thy glory; and when the fulneſs of time was come, thou by thy moſt holy Son didſt declare, that thou wilt be preſent in all places, where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy Name; and that amongſt all Nations for ever, Thy houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer; and by thy Apoſtle haſt ſignified to us, that our dwelling houſes are to eat and drink in, but that we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Churches of God. For thou art a jealous God, and wilt not endure that thy Temples ſhould be defiled. Our God is a conſuming fire, and he that defiles a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, him will God deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Therefore in confidence of thy goodneſs, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy favours, in full aſſurance of thy promiſes, in obedience to the manifold declaration of thy pleaſure, and in imitation of the piety of thy ſervants, who in all the generations of the world have ſeparated places and houſes for thy ſervice, and left great monuments of their piety for our comfort and example, that we may come together into one place, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Be pleaſed therefore, moſt gracious Lord and Father, to accept the devotion and oblation of thy ſervants: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this place and houſe into a portion of thine own inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: Let it be a reſting place for thy feet, and the ſeat of thy Graciouſneſs.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104442:17"/> deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Wouldſt not thou be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us?</p>
            <p>O Lord God of Heaven and earth, thou art righteous, and juſt, and true; thou art alſo good and gracious, and of great mercy, and loving kindneſs; and though thou haſt puniſhed us for our inventions, yet thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given our miſdeeds, and reſtor'd us to a rejoycing this day. O give unto us abundance of thy grace, that we may no more provoke thee to anger, or to jealouſie; that we may never force thee to ſeverity, and to pour forth thy heavy judgements upon us: but give us thy holy Spirit to lead us in the ways of righteouſneſs, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for thy mercies for ever. Defend thy Church, and bleſs thine inheritance; feed them, and ſet them up for ever: So ſhall we thy people give thee thanks in the Congregation of thy redeemed ones, and rejoyce in giving thee praiſes for the operations of thy hands, who haſt mightily delivered thy ſons and ſervants through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>12. That our ſons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be as the poliſhed corners of the temple.</p>
            <p>13. That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of ſtore: that our ſheep may bring forth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and ten thouſands in our ſtreets.</p>

            <p>O Almighty God, who art of pure eyes, and canſt not behold impurity, behold the Angels are not pure in thy ſight, and thou haſt found folly in thy Saints; have mercy upon thy ſervants, who with repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of heart, return unto thee humbling our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in thy holy place. We acknowledge our ſelves unworthy to appear in thy glorious preſence, becauſe we are polluted in thy ſight, and it is juſt in thee to reject our prayers, and to anſwer us no more from the place of thy Sanctuary; for wickedneſs hath entred into the Courts where thy holy feet have trod, and have defiled thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, even unto the ground, and we by our ſins have deſerved this calamity.

Caſt out all iniquity from within us, remove the guilt of that horrible prophanation that hath been committed here, that abomination of deſolation in the holy place, ſtanding where it ought not; and grant that we may preſent unto thee pure Oblations, and may be accepted by the gracious interpellation of our High Prieſt, the moſt glorious Jeſus.
